Search for Sunshine Console, check its checkbox, and click **Add Package**.\r\n\r\n\r\nNuGet will automatically add Sunshine Console (and OpenTK, which it requires) to your project.\r\n\r\n### Option #2 - Download the .zip\r\nGo to the [latest release](https://github.com/derrickcreamer/SunshineConsole/releases/latest) and download SunshineConsole.zip. Extract it somewhere that your project can access it (I prefer to put it in the main project directory with my .cs files). Now it's time to add these files as references in your project.\r\n- For VS, go to [**Solution Explorer**](http://blogs.msdn.com/cfs-filesystemfile.ashx/__key/communityserver-components-postattachments/00-01-99-79-48/SolutionExplorer_2D00_Step1.JPG) and right-click **References**, then select **Add Reference**. Go to the **Browse** tab and locate the files you just extracted. Add both **SunshineConsole.dll and OpenTK.dll** as references.\r\n- For XS/MD, go to the **Solution view** and right-click **References**, then select **Edit References**. Go to the **.Net Assembly** tab and click the **Browse** button near the bottom. Locate the files you just extracted and add both **SunshineConsole.dll and OpenTK.dll**.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
